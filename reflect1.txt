How did viewing a diff between two version of a file help you spot the bug?

-It is no need for logic or understanding just match picture togather and
see what diffs. So it is faster and more effective to have a old version 
around.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-It enables me to undo mistakes and fail experiment.
To have access to entire hsitory, we can avoid repeat
the same mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-Manually save is easier to understand and clear purpose,
or even flexible. However, if blackout happens, all the
works will gone in thin air. So auto save get the 10 points 
on that matter, even though it is not flexible and tidious sth.

Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-Because of the common use of these vc-systems are different. 
Google Doc is for word processing, unlikely to have connection 
between files, not like git for coding. And maybe because of
the size of file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files?

- In the floder of repo??, type git log with show you versions of 
file(s), start with the most recent one.
Git diff compare diff between two files(more??), - sign indicate 
existance in first version, + sign for second version.

How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that could break something?

- I feel like I can travel back in time, Cooolllll
But it would be better if it shows IDs of the newer versions of 
the (checkpoint), not detact my HEAD. Still usefull tho.

Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?

- I will use it in class that waiting for me.
