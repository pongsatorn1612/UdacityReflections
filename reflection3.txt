When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When I have to work with other people or what to do it remotely everywhere though internet.

git remote (-v)-> check special stage refer to repos at Gidhub (URL info).
git remote add <remote name> <URL of Github repos> -> creat new remote and 
                  link it to Github repos.
git push <remote> <branch> -> send commits from branch@local to remote@Github.
git pull <remote> <branch@Github> -> copy commits from branch@Github contain in 
                  remote repos to local current branch@local
